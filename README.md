## Why use MARTINS.js?

Here is why MARTINS.js is a great choice for creating Augmented Reality experiences:

* **No need to download apps!** MARTINS.js is a WebAR engine. It runs in web browsers. Users can access the AR experience immediately.
* **Fast and powerful!** MARTINS.js is GPU-accelerated. It uses WebGL2 and WebAssembly for turbocharged performance.
* **No need of custom hardware or software!** MARTINS.js is built from scratch using standard web technologies. All it requires is a modern and compatible web browser.
* **Fully standalone!** MARTINS.js has in it everything it needs to analyze the environment and help you create AR. There are no additional requirements. It's not WebXR.
* **Easy to get started!** MARTINS.js can be used with a `<script>` tag in your page. A static HTML page is enough to get started.
