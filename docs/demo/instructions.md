# Try WebAR right now!

## Follow the steps

1. Scan or tap the QR code below with a mobile device.
2. A [web page](./index.md) will be opened. It's the WebAR experience.
3. The web page will request access to your webcam. Authorize it.
4. Scan the cartoon below.
5. Enjoy! :wink:

!!! info "Guidelines for WebAR"

    - WebGL2 and WebAssembly are required. Use a [compatible browser](../getting-started/index.md#browser-compatibility).
    - Don't move the camera too quickly - it produces motion blur.
    - The physical environment should be properly illuminated.
    - Avoid low-quality cameras (cameras of common smartphones are OK).
