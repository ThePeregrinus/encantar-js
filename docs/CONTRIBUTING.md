# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MARTINS.js! Here are some ways you can contribute:

## Support my work

I develop MARTINS.js independently and I release it as open-source software. Developing and maintaining this project requires a lot of skill, and I think it must be sustainable. I ask for support to be able to continue this work. If WebAR is meaningful to you or to your business, please [support my work with a paid membership](https://alemart.github.io/martins-js/support-my-work) and [purchase my WebAR demos](https://alemart.github.io/martins-js/demos).

## Spread the word

Augmented Reality is a joy to work with. :sunglasses: Spread the joy to your social media! Tell your friends and clients about the amazing, creative #WebAR experiences you are building with #MARTINSjs. They will surely like to hear from you, and you will also be helping this project by spreading the word about it.

## Help others

If you're technically savvy, please offer your advice to others asking for help on the community at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/alemart/martins-js/discussions). Even though there is complexity to this project, some questions may be technically simple, and a competent developer may be able to answer them accurately. If you feel that you're able to answer a question accurately, please do. You will be helping others and also learning for yourself in the process.

## Pull requests

I do not accept any pull requests to this repository at this time. If you make a suggestion and include some code as a proof-of-concept, I will most likely appreciate it. However, please do not feel offended if I do not use the code you provide, and instead decide to rewrite it.
