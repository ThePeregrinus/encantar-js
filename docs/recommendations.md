# Recommendations for WebAR

For a good experience with WebAR:

* Don't move the camera nor the target image too quickly. This produces motion blur.
* The target image should appear clearly in the video.
* The physical environment should be properly illuminated.
* If you're scanning the image on a screen, make sure to adjust the brightness. If the screen is too bright (too dark), it will cause overexposure (underexposure) in the video and tracking difficulties - details of the images will be lost. Screen reflections are also undesirable.
* If you print the image, avoid shiny materials (e.g., glossy paper). They may generate artifacts in the image and interfere with the tracking. Prefer non-reflective materials.
* Avoid low-quality cameras. Cameras of common smartphones are okay.
